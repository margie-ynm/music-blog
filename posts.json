  "title": "The Wilderness by Explosions in the Sky",
  "body": "One description that has followed Explosions in the Sky around for their whole career is 'cinematic,' a sort of shorthand to describe music featuring awe-inspiring peaks and valleys, a sort of star-gazing for the ears. The Wilderness doesn't exactly throw this formula out the window, but modifies it into something noticeably more urgent, a layer of angst being brought to their sound by harder hitting drums, and less drastic song structures. The beauty we've all become accustomed to is still here, but there's more of an edge this time around.",

  "title": "California by Blink-182",
  "body": "There's absolutely no point in explaining this one at all; Blink-182 is (to my ears, anyway) basically the purest form of guilty pleasure, and unlike their previous release, California actually makes these Neverland residents sound like the bratty punk pop masters they once were.",
